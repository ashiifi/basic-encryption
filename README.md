# basic-encryption
A very basic sample of encryption
run the encryption.py file

encryption(S,n) takes in a string and a number. It then moves each letter in the string
by n amount of times through the alphabet. In this way, 'encrypting' the string
then decryption(W) takes in the encrypted string with the n at the end of it. like "helloworld1"
